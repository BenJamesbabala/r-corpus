To Do
=====

`summary.text`

`vocab()` for type/token frequencies

`tokens()` for word tokens. Returns character()

`blocks()` for fixed-length chunks of words. Read up on time series block
bootstrap to get inspiration for interface.

`word_counts()` for word count matrix; groups argument for collapsing rows.

Bootstrapping. Not sure what the interface should look like, but should
support sentence-level, word-level, block-level.
